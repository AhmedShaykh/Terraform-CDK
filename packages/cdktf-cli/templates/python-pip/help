Use Providers:

  You can add prebuilt providers (if available) or locally generated ones using the add command:
  
  cdktf provider add "aws@~>3.0" null kreuzwerker/docker

  You can find all prebuilt providers on PyPI: https://pypi.org/user/cdktf-team/
  You can also add these providers directly to your requirements.txt file.

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers
