# Terraform CDK

Terraform CDK (Cloud Development Kit) allows developers to use familiar
programming languages to define cloud infrastructure and provision it through
Terraform.

This is a prototype.


## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Clone and build this repository (until this is released):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/eladb/tfcdk
$ cd tfcdk
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

The `playground` directory is where you should create new projects. Bear in mind that the directory structure is fixed since generated code references files within this repository, so follow these instructions:

```shell
$ mkdir playground/my-awesome-project
$ cd playground/my-awesome-project
$ terraform init
```

TODO






```
mkdir sample
```
