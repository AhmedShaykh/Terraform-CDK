# Typescript AWS with Prebuilt Provider

A CDK for Terraform application in TypeScript using the prebuilt [AWS provider](https://cdk.tf/provider/aws).

## Usage

Install project dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

You can now edit the [main.ts](./main.ts) file if you want to modify any code.

Perform a `cdktf diff` to get a plan of what would be deployed.
