# Remote Templates

When you set up a new project via `cdktf init`, you can supply one of the [built-in templates](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/tree/main/packages/cdktf-cli/templates) (e.g. `typescript` or `python`) or use a custom-built remote template. Templates scaffold a new CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) project, creating the necessary directories and files.

## Create Remote Templates

A template is a directory that contains at least a `cdktf.json` file, which is required for the `cdktf` CLI. You can use the library [`sscaff`](https://github.com/awslabs/node-sscaff) to scaffold a new project. The `sscaff` library copies all files into the new project directory while allowing for substitutions and hooks.

### Substitutions

A template can use substitutions for filenames and file content. To specify your own variables, use Hooks (details below). In addition to the [built-in substitutions of](https://github.com/awslabs/node-sscaff#built-in-substitutions) `sccaff`, CDKTF supplies variables that you can use in templates.

#### User Input

These variables hold user input. For example, you can use them in project files like `package.json` or similar.

The data is collected as part of the `cdktf init` workflow. While `Name` and `Description` are mandatory, `OrganizationName` and `WorkspaceName` will only be present for projects which are setup to use a Terraform Cloud remote backend

- An init workflow with local state `cdktf init --template ./my-template --local`
- An init workflow with remote backend `cdktf init --template ./my-template`

```typescript
Name: string;
Description: string;
OrganizationName?: string;
WorkspaceName?: string;
```

#### Versions

These variables contain the correct versionsthat are depending on the cdktf-cli that scaffolds the template. The package names are provided in the correct format for the given platform. See the [built-in templates](../../packages/cdktf-cli/templates) as reference of how you can use them.

```typescript
cdktf_version: string;
constructs_version: string;
npm_cdktf: string;
npm_cdktf_cli: string;
pypi_cdktf: string;
mvn_cdktf: string;
nuget_cdktf: string;
```

The recommended workflow is to use these variables as they are provided without providing any custom logic on top of this.

### `pre` and `post` Hooks

[Hooks](https://github.com/awslabs/node-sscaff#hooks) allow you to run additional logic before and after the generation of the output.

### Debug Remote Templates

Add `console.log()` statements to your hook functions. CDK for Terraform displays this log output when a user initializes a project from your template.

You can also set the environment variable `CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` before invoking `cdktf init` to see more debugging output. The debugging output will be printed on stdout.

The temporary directory into which your zip archive is downloaded. This can help if you're unsure how your archive behaves.

## Distribute Remote Templates

Currently, `cdktf init` downloads and and extracts a zip archive containing the files for the template. It searches all directories and extracts the directory containing the `cdktf.json` file. This allows you to create content (e.g. a `README.md`) in the root directory that won't appear in the project directory generated by your template.

A remote template can be hosted anywhwere, as long as it is a zip archive.

If you happen to host your remote template in a Github repository, you don't have to manually create zip archive since Github allows fetching the repository contents as zip archive.

#### main branch

`https://github.com/<user or organization>/<repo>/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

#### tag `v.0.0.1`

`https://github.com/<user or organization>/<repo>/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.1.zip`

-> **Note:** You can only specify urls to zip archives, so only url based authentication mechanisms are supported. If you need support for private packages, please [file an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues/new?labels=enhancement%2C+new&template=feature-request.md).

## Use Remote Templates

The following [remote templates](./docs/working-with-cdk-for-terraform/remote-templates.md) are maintained by the community and can be used to setup a CDK for Terraform project.

```
$ cdktf init --template https://github.com/<user or organization>/<repo>/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.1.zip
```
