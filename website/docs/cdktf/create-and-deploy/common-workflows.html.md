# Common Workflows

Explain the workflows that users would follow to use CDKTF to deploy infrastructure. *Reinforce that every single provider and module is supported.

- Deployment workflows
- CI workflows (commercial + OSS users)
- Talk about how you can either use CDKTF to create and destroy infrastructure OR you can run a Synthesize and run Terraform commands directly. (link to synth command)
- Watch - automatically redeploy (link to watch command details)
- Mention that it can be used with or without Terraform Cloud
- Talk about how you can use the CLI (and the benefits of this) and mention that you can also use CDKTF to plan/deploy your application → it’s not the case that you just run Terraform on the output (you can do that too though, if you want)
- Maintaining (renaming resources, etc.)
