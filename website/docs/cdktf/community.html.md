# Community

CDK for Terraform is a rapidly-growing project and the development team would love your feedback and direct contributions to help guide the project.

## Questions & Issues
If you have questions, the HashiCorp [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/) platform using the [terraform-cdk](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core/cdk-for-terraform/) category is the best place for general discussion. If you run into issues or have ideas for improvements, please file a [bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=) or request a new [feature](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request.md&title=). Please let us know if you'd like to talk - we are very interested in seeing how people use CDK for Terraform in practice.

## Contributing
The CDK for Terraform project is very open to community contributions. The easiest way to help is to file bugs when you run into issues, comment on existing issues if you're seeing them, and comment or upvote on feature requests if you have use cases where they would be helpful. Hearing _why_ you're interested extremely useful.

If you're interested in contributing code, please look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide. Before you file a large pull request, please file an enhancement request, and tell us that you're interested in building it. We're happy to work together on design, to make sure your PR can be reviewed and accepted quickly.

## Roadmap
CDK for Terraform is released on a monthly cadence. To see what's planned next, look at [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/milestones). Typically, releases beyond the next are planned tentatively. Issues labeled `committed` will land in the planned release, and all others are implicitly stretch goals, and may shift to a future release if they don't get done in time for the release.
